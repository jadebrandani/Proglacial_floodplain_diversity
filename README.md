# Proglacial_floodplain_diversity
Investigating the diversity patterns of pstreams draining progalcial floodplains through analysis of water physio-chemical parameters, biofilm biomass and activity, alpha diversity, comunity structure and co-occurence network analysis. 

The data can be found on: (to be filled) 

R script available: 
- Water physiochemical parameters: Water_physiochemical.R
- Sediment Biomass Indicators : Sediment_biomass.R
- Alpha Diversity : Richness + evenness on both lateral and longitudinal dimensions, Venn diagrams, taxonomic composition (Alpha_diversity.R)
- Fischer enrichment : Fischer_enrichment.R
- Community structure : Betadiversity_16S_18S.R
- Co-occurence Network : Pre-processing and plotting (Network_Analysis.R)
